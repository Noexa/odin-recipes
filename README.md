This project is an attempt to showcase the HTML knowledge I've learned from The Odin Project. This project should contain an index page that will link to three other receipe pages. Each page should contmain an image, a few headers, a couple lists, and some descriptions of the dish. This project is meant to be function over form so the aesthetics of it will be pretty barebone.
